            "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 took fans to the dance floor with her single 'Break My Soul.' The song sampled 'Show Me Love,' a '90s house classic by Robin S. Robin found out that Beyonc\u00e9 sampled her song when everybody else did.",
            "content": "Beyonc\u00e9\u2018s comeback single \u201cBreak My Soul\u201d has gotten the whole world dancing, with many viewing the song as an indicator of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s immersion into house music. The song itself samples a \u201990s house classic, Robin S.\u2019s \u201cShow Me Love.\u201d And despite having to clear a sample for one of the biggest entertainers in the world, Robin S. didn\u2019t know Beyonc\u00e9 sampled her song until it was released and listeners made her name go viral. Robin S. | Scott Dudelson/Getty Images Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s song \u2018Break My Soul\u2019 samples Robin S.\u2019s song \u2018Show Me Love\u2019 Robin S. first released \u201cShow Me Love\u201d in 1990. The song was instrumental in making house music mainstream. In the years that followed, several hit songs featured female vocalists singing over dancefloor-ready beats, including \u201cGypsy Woman\u201d and \u201c100% Pure Love\u201d by Crystal Waters and \u201cFree\u201d by Ultra Nat\u00e9. By reworking \u201cShow Me Love\u201d for \u201cBreak My Soul,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 paid homage to a house music trailblazer. Robin found out about the sample when everyone else did Robin S. told Good Morning Britain the story of when she found out Beyonc\u00e9 sampled \u201cShow Me Love\u201d \u2014 and showed Robin love in the process. \u201cMy son called me and he\u2019s like, \u2018Mom! Mom! You\u2019re trending all over the place! Beyonc\u00e9 put her song out and it\u2019s \u2018Show Me Love\u2019 and you\u2019re trending everywhere!\u201d she recounted. The singer went on to share her gratitude with Beyonc\u00e9 and her collaborators. \u201cThis message goes out to the Queen Bey herself, Beyonc\u00e9, to\u00a0Jay-Z, to the entire team,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you so much for giving me my flowers while I\u2019m still alive. I am honored, and I\u2019m excited to see what else can happen.\u201d She revealed to Australia\u2019s ABC that she had no idea that Beyonc\u00e9 had even worked \u201cShow Me Love\u201d into her own song. \u201cI\u2019m a person of transparency: I did not know about this single,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cI knew nothing about it. Nothing.\u201d \u201cThis morning when I woke up and my alarm went off, so did my phone,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt just kept going off. It kept pinging, pinging, pinging, pinging, pinging.\u201d Overall, the singer couldn\u2019t be more thrilled with the Queen Bey herself shining a light on an often-forgotten musician. \u201cI have a plethora of emotions going on right now,\u201d she said. \u201cElated, proud, happy, shocked, excited. I just keep going up and down the scale here.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to cry because I\u2019m so happy, or to laugh because this is so exciting, or do both at the same time,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m just moved. Because most times people give you your accolades after you\u2019ve transitioned from this world. So, to be able to enjoy my flowers while I\u2019m alive, I\u2019m giddy. It feels good!\u201d 'I'm honoured and excited to see what else can happen.'Singer Robin S tells @RichardAArnold how she felt when she heard @Beyonce's new song, Break My Soul. Robin's song 'Show Me Love' is thought to be sampled on Beyonce's latest single. pic.twitter.com/za24JEg9Bj\u2014 Good Morning Britain (@GMB) June 22, 2022 Robin is proud of Beyonc\u00e9 Robin S. admires Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s artistry, and even teased that she and the Queen Bey could work together. \u201cMaybe we can do a collab together,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s always a dream.\u201d Robin shared with ABC that as a longtime fan of Beyonc\u00e9, she couldn\u2019t be happier with how she\u2019s evolved up until this point in her career. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of her,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been proud of her. Because she\u2019s put out stuff that puts women in a position to understand who they are and the power that they have in this world. Because we were made to feel, in the industry, that we were subservient. The industry was always a man\u2019s world and certain women had to give in or sell their souls in order to make it. She\u2019s changed the game.\u201d \u201cHer delivery is always on point with her songs,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cYou feel what she\u2019s feeling when she\u2019s singing it. That right there is what it\u2019s all about. If I feel what you feel when you are singing this, it\u2019s a groovy thing, it\u2019s a great situation, it\u2019s a wonderful marriage.\u201d RELATED: Beyonc\u00e9 Secretly Revealed the Title of Her \u2018Renaissance\u2019 Album a Year Before Its Release",

Not only did she make her late-night debut, appearing on The Tonight Show on Wednesday, but she also released her first new YouTube video in six months.This is big news for Chambermaids (I assume that\u2019s what the fans call themselves): After all, it\u2019s Emma\u2019s videos that propelled her to become the Met Gala-attending starlet she is today. While her style has evolved over time, from chaotic prank videos with other YouTubers to funny glimpses into her daily life, the Emma Chamberlain Cinematic Universe has preserved the 21-year-old\u2019s irreverent, fast-talking sense of humor.That\u2019s not not present in \u201cwhat\u2019s good in new york,\u201d her grand return to YouTube (which, as of early Thursday afternoon, is the No. 1 trending video on the site with over 2.2 million views and counting). But the video also appears to mark a new era for Emma\u2014fitting, since she is a completely different level of celebrity now than she was even six months ago. Yet for this New Yorker, who eagerly clicked on the video as soon as she saw it, this era ain\u2019t it.Read more at The Daily Beast.",

            "content": "Khaby Lame, a 21-year-old from Italy, has gone viral for his deadpan reaction clips and comic sketches.Screenshot/TikTok - @khaby.lame Khaby Lame just passed Charli D'Amelio as the most-followed TikTok creator. Lame is famous for his comic expressions and deadpan reactions to overstylized TikToks. On social media, users are now calling 22-year-old Lame the \"king of TikTok.\" In one of Khabane Lame's TikTok videos from last year, he reacted to a clip of someone using scissors to open a container of milk. To show how it's done, Lame simply peeled a milk carton open and poured the liquid into a glass while smiling goofily at the camera.It's a simple act, something most people do every day. But the video has over 8 million likes.\u00a0On Wednesday, Lame, 22, surpassed 18-year-old Charli D'Amelio to become the most-followed TikToker in the world. While D'Amelio currently has 142.2 million followers on the app, Lame now has a following of 142.6 million.His following has grown rapidly over the past few years, and in July 2021, he surpassed the 22-year-old influencer Addison Rae to become the second most-followed creator in the world.\u00a0Lame is a Senegalese-Italian creator based in Italy who began making TikToks under the handle \"Khaby Lame\" after he lost his job working in a northern Italy factory during the pandemic, The New York Times reported.When The Times spoke with Lame in June 2021, he was bubbling around 65 million followers on TikTok. Within a month, the creator vaulted to 84 million, and less than a full year later, he has now gained an additional 62 million followers.\u00a0Here is how Lame built his following to become the most popular creator on TikTok.\u00a0Lame is known for breaking the fourth wall in his videos\u00a0Lame's earliest videos, which date back to March 2020, were a mix of dance parodies such as doing the \"woah\" while soaping his hands and random meme skits, like pretending to DJ with pieces from a chess set. @khaby.lame \u266c Baila Conmigo #3 - Dayvi, V\u00edctor C\u00e1rdenas feat. Kelly Ru\u00edz He became famous for his comic expressions and reaction videos, and by looking at the camera, he breaks the fourth wall \u2014 almost like TikTok's version of Jim Halpert from \"The Office,\" who served as the sitcom's straight man.\u00a0\"It's my face and my facial expressions that make people laugh,\" he told The Times. @khaby.lame Let\u2019s eat \ud83c\udf52 But I don't like seeing you make your life harder. Mangiamo \ud83c\udf52 ma non mi piace che ti complichi la vita.##learnfromkhaby ##LearnWithTikTok \u266c suono originale - Khabane lame Lame's videos are also characterized by a sarcastic form of 'silent comedy'Another reason why Lame's videos have stood out to viewers is that the TikToker practically never speaks in them.\u00a0The creator often uses the hashtag #LearnfromKhaby under his videos, where he uses comedic sketches and facial expressions to teach viewers how to do various tasks, like draining pasta water out of a pot, or picking up your keys when they've fallen under a chair.\u00a0 @khaby.lame Wow I'm so impressed how you drain the pasta!! Don\u2019t you? \ud83d\ude02 Sono cosi impressionato da come scoli la pasta\u201d tu no?\ud83d\ude02#learnfromkhaby #learnwithtiktok \u266c suono originale - Khabane lame His videos appear to mock TikTok \"life hacks,\" a popular genre where users claim to offer advice on finding easier ways to do tasks. By silently doing the same task from the life hack video in a seemingly easier way, Lame has been praised for his comedic presence.\u00a0One video from August 2021 shows\u00a0a person using an extravagant clipping device to grasp a cherry and remove its stem. Then, it switches to Lame sitting on a train with two cherries in front of him. He grabs one, looks into the camera, and yanks the stem. He pops the cherry into his mouth while shaking his head slowly, as if to say, \"How easy was that?\"The video has 168 million views. @khaby.lame Next time be careful mate \ud83d\udc68 \ud83c\udf5f \ud83d\ude29 Prossima volta stai pi\u00f9 attento bro \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udf5f\ud83d\ude29 ##learnfromkhaby ##learnwithtiktok ##imparacontiktok \u266c suono originale - Khabane lame In June, Lame told Vogue, \"The funniest part of my content is the silence,\" adding, \"Silent comedy speaks a language that everybody in the world can understand.\"\u00a0Fans have constantly made remarks about Lame's distinct style on TikTok. \"This man has never even spoken a word and has almost 100 million followers,\" one comment with 150,000 likes said under a TikTok posted by Lame in July 2021. Another commenter wrote, \"Have you always wondered what his voice sounds like?,\" in August last year.\u00a0In addition to making TikToks, Lame said he's a passionate soccer fan \u2014 his favorite team is Juventus F.C., a club from Turin, Italy. He also named Eddie Murphy and Will Smith as two of his biggest inspirations, telling The Times he'd like to reach their level of comedy one day.Lame offers an antidote to the professional polish of TikTok's top starsOne main reason for Lame's startling success seems to be how his videos are in contrast to many of the videos from top creators like Rae and D'Amelio.\u00a0 @khaby.lame \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffe#learnfromkhaby #learnwithtiktok #imparacontiktok \u266c suono originale - Khabane lame Where many big video makers use high-quality cameras, intoxicating music, and carefully plan their lighting, Lame ditches those influencer trappings. His videos are often quiet and alluringly realistic. Instead of flexing ultra-smooth dance moves or entrancing transition skills, Lame frequently just sits in front of the camera. He doesn't bother to optimize the lighting, use color filters or edit his videos at all, which lends an air of authenticity.Lame's fame has become so wide-reaching that fan compilations titled \"Khaby Lame BEST TikToks\" and \"Funniest Khabane Lame Compilation\" have each reached over 10 million views on YouTube. He has Instagram fan accounts with tens of thousands of followers. There's even a Reddit forum with almost 1,000 members devoted to sharing information about him.Lame's supporters were rooting for the TikToker to become the most popular creator in the world\u00a0In early May, Noah Glenn Carter, a creator with 4.8 million followers who often goes viral for sharing trending news and TikTok drama updates, posted a series of videos saying he wanted to help Lame become the most followed creator in the world.\u00a0 @noahglenncarter Let\u2019s goo #khabylame #charlidamelio #foryou #khabytonumberone \u266c About Damn Time - Lizzo Carter urged people to follow Lame, and his videos cumulatively received millions of views and likes. The hashtag #KhabyToNumberOne, which was popularized by Carter, now has more than 15 million TikTok views.\u00a0\u2014\u1d22\u1d07\u1d1c\ua731 (@BadaVase) June 22, 2022When Lame surpassed D'Amelio's follower count on June 22, users on TikTok and Twitter\u00a0congratulated Lame, with many people\u00a0dubbing him the \"king of TikTok.\"\u00a0Lame did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\u00a0To read more stories like this, check out Insider's digital culture coverage\u00a0here.Read the original article on Insider",

Over the past few days, Banks became a trending topic following the release of Drake 's dance album Honestly, Nevermind and Beyonc\u00e9's new single, \" Break My Soul. \" Fans have been giving their flowers to her and giving her the recognition she deserves . Some fans have gone ahead with creating unofficial mash-ups between Beyonc\u00e9's latest record and a few records from Banks' catalog. One remix that's popped up is a mash-up between \"Break My Soul\" and \"Fuck Him All Night,\" but it doesn't seem like Azealia isn't necessarily fond of it. The rapper hit her Instagram Story this morning where she requested that fans put a halt to these remixes. She went as far as describing them as \"horrible.\" \"Please for the love of God. Stop the Break My Soul AB mashups,\" she wrote. \"They are horrible.\" Earlier this month, Azealia Banks released her latest single, \"I Rule The World,\" produced by Shlomo. The Harlem creative shared her last project, Yung Rapunxel: Pt. I I in 2019. Does Azealia Banks get her just dues?

            "content": "Welcome to Billboard Pro\u2019s Trending Up newsletter, where we take a closer look at the songs, artists, curiosities and trends that have caught the music industry\u2019s attention. Some have come out of nowhere, others have taken months to catch on, and all of them could become ubiquitous in the blink of a TikTok clip. This week: Bailey Zimmerman is forging new territory for a modern country crossover, while Doja Cat scores another hit, Joji keeps gaining momentum and ABBA gets the sped-up treatment. Viral Country Star Bailey Zimmerman \u201cRock\u201ds the Hot 100 The traditional country path up the charts \u2013 usually done through radio airplay built slowly over the course of several months \u2013 is such a gradual one that when an artist (particularly a newer one) crashes in, it tends to draw notice. Such is the case with Bailey Zimmerman, whose breakout hit \u201cFall in Love\u201d has been scaling the Billboard Hot 100 over the past seven weeks \u2013 only to see the song immediately overtaken by its follow-up, \u201cRock and a Hard Place.\u201d The 22-year-old singer-songwriter (signed to Warner Music Nashville/Elektra Music Group), whose music carries more than a faint resemblance to similarly viral predecessor Morgan Wallen, teased his new ballad extensively on TikTok before its debut earlier this month. The built-up momentum led to a resounding No. 24 debut on the Hot 100 for \u201cRock\u201d this week (chart dated June 25) \u2013 thanks in large part to 11 million first-week streams, according to Luminate. It leapfrogs \u201cFall in Love,\u201d which climbs six spots to No. 46 in its seventh week on the listing, and is only just starting to be embraced by radio, debuting at No. 54 this week on Billboard\u2019s Country Airplay listing. \u2014 Andrew Unterberger Doja Cat\u2019s Still Got the Hot Hand Considering the win streak that Doja Cat has been on over the past few years, and peaking with last year\u2019s Planet Her album \u2014 up to six top 40 hits on the Hot 100, with \u201cGet Into It (Yuh)\u201d streaking up 11 spots to No. 33 this week \u2014 it was more than forgivable that \u201cVegas,\u201d her \u201cHound Dog\u201d-interpolating single from Baz Luhrmann\u2019s upcoming Elvis Presley biopic, started off slowly upon its release last month. Perhaps Doja had simply reached a mainstream saturation point that couldn\u2019t accommodate a soundtrack hits amongst her many other big singles! Nope: \u201cVegas\u201d is quickly becoming a hit now, too, after viral dance clips on TikTok helped boost its listenership. The song zooms up 19 spots on the Hot 100 to No. 56, earning 9.1 million U.S. on-demand streams in the week ending June 16, up nearly 13% from the previous week, according to Luminate. Radio is also starting to bet on \u201cVegas,\u201d with 631,000 airplay audience impressions among 72 reporters to Billboard\u2019s Radio Songs chart in the week ending June 20. With Elvis hitting theaters on Friday, \u201cVegas\u201d could keep rising into the upper tier of the Hot 100 for Doja Cat, joining the dexterous star\u2019s Post Malone collaboration \u201cI Like You (A Happier Song)\u201d (No. 14 this week), \u201cWoman\u201d (No. 23) and \u201cGet Into It (Yuh).\u201d \u2014 Jason Lipshutz ABBA \u201cEyes\u201d an Unusual TikTok Comeback You wouldn\u2019t necessarily listen to most songs by \u201970s and \u201980s pop eternals ABBA and think they needed to be even faster and more chipper, but TikTok users apparently feel differently \u2013 at least about their 1979 single \u201cAngeleyes.\u201d The song, a relatively minor hit for the group (peaking at No. 64 on the Hot 100), has become a fixture on the app in recent weeks via a sped-up version, often used to soundtrack photo montages (set to the song\u2019s bittersweet \u201cit hurts to remember all the good times\u201d lyric). The accompanying bump has led to the song rising from weekly streams in the 300,000s for most of May to nearly 1.8 million official streams in the U.S. last week, according to Luminate \u2013 netting higher consumption numbers than almost any of ABBA\u2019s more well-known classics, short only of the all-timer \u201cDancing Queen\u201d (nearly 2.4 million streams in the week). \u2014 A.U. Get a \u201cGlimpse\u201d of the Joji Catalog Bump Joji\u2019s \u201cGlimpse of Us\u201d debuting at No. 10 on this week\u2019s Hot 100 marks a breakthrough moment for the 88rising artist \u2014 and naturally, some listeners who were previously unfamiliar with his sultry croon have started to tear his back catalog. This week, Joji\u2019s total U.S. on-demand streams even without \u201cGlimpse\u201d included were 22.16 million \u2014 a 73.8% jump compared with the 12.75 million streams earned by the same catalog the week before the new single came out, according to Luminate. \u201cSlow Dancing in the Dark,\u201d the waltzing standout from Joji\u2019s 2018 album Ballads 1, is the biggest recipient, up nearly 43% percent in streams to 3.76 million last week. While \u201cGlimpse of You\u201d continues strong near the top of streaming charts like Spotify\u2019s Top 50, \u201cSlow Dancing in the Dark\u201d has crept onto the bottom of the same charts, signaling a general appetite for Joji\u2019s music beyond his viral new hit. \u2014 J.L. Q&A: Manny Toro, SoundCloud\u2019s vp of global music marketing, on What\u2019s Trending Up in His World What music industry trend has defined the first half of 2022? Democratization of the industry and putting the power in the hands of artists; simply meaning an artist has more choice and control in who and how they want to work with someone to build and grow their career. It\u2019s amazing to see new tools and solutions being developed every day around artist needs that they can use to to grow their careers on their own terms, and be successful in their journey from user-centric streaming models to tools and platforms for artists to share and market their work themselves. Additionally, technology has completely upended the industry status quo by breaking down the barrier between artists and fans. Today, we are in an environment where nothing separates the artist from the fan as they can share, connect and engage directly. We are in the age of the fan economy and the industry is recognizing the power and influence of fandom \u2014 finding engaged fan bases and then being able to follow, develop, and reach them. Are there any songs, artists or genres you\u2019re keeping an eye on that you think will be in greater demand in the near future? On the platform, we\u2019re able to see the birth of new communities and the rise in their engagement with other artists and fans as they grow in real-time. One that I have my eye on is the rising hip-hop \u201cplugg\u201d scene that first originated within tight-knit communities in Atlanta. Artists in and around the scene like BabySantana, Sojabrat, Bear1Boss and Bktherula are ushering in a new wave of hip-hop and inspiring new plugg-influenced subgenres and micro-communities that are popping off on SoundCloud and set to be what\u2019s next in music. Methods of music consumption have changed greatly over the course of the streaming era, let alone the past few years. What\u2019s one way you\u2019d like to see them continue to evolve? Artists can find major success when they leverage the right platform at the right time in the right way. I\u2019d like to see more active and intentional listening and deeper real-time engagement between artists and fans. Deeper engagement opportunities make interactions mean something more than they ever have before, by building innovative, integrated ecosystems to drive the artist-fan relationship across multiple touchpoints. This includes opening up channels for commercial opportunities outside of the album or single cycle, like exclusive content, merch or tickets \u2014 making direct interaction no longer only about amassing streams, but creating additional avenues for creators who might not otherwise be able to live off of their craft. Fill in the blank: in the second half of 2022, everyone in music will be talking about ______________. New ways for artists to rise up in the industry through creative, custom partnerships. In my experience leading music and brand marketing at Nike and Red Bull, I\u2019ve seen how the right artist partnership can introduce artists to new, massive global audiences and open up new opportunities for them to catapult their careers. At SoundCloud, we\u2019re partnering directly with artists, indie players, including labels and artist services companies, to bring the best possible, bespoke solution for artists to take the next step in their journey in a way that makes the most sense for them. The industry is embracing these new kinds of nontraditional partnerships now more than ever. \u2014 J.L. Trending Back Then: Jimmy Eat World Reach the \u201cMiddle\u201d of the Mainstream At the turn of the 21st century, emo was gaining cultural capital as one of the most vital strains of rock music coming out of the Midwest and tri-state areas, even though it had yet to make much of a mainstream breakthrough. But it just took some time for a quartet from Mesa, Arizona, to make a crossover banger so undeniable that pop audiences couldn\u2019t ignore it: Jimmy Eat World\u2019s 2002 smash \u201cThe Middle,\u201d which applied the heartfelt vocals and cathartic guitars that characterized the genre to a universally accessible anthem of preservation and individuality. Paired with a clich\u00e9-inverting video that took over MTV, the song took over top 40 radio and raced up the Billboard Hot 100 \u2013 peaking at No. 5 on the chart dated June 22 \u2013 marking emo\u2019s first true pop breakout hit, though far from the last. \u2014 A.U.",
